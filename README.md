django-uwsgi-nginx-ssh-fat
==========================

Django 1.5.1 with uwsgi, nginx and SSH plus a bunch of pre-installed requirements.

It doesn't make much sense for you to be using this docker, instead I recommend
taking a look at [django-uwsgi-nginx-ssh](https://registry.hub.docker.com/u/andresriancho/django-uwsgi-nginx-ssh/),
which gives you the same features but without the pre-installed libraries (which
are specific to Django applications I'm coding).
